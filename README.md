# K-Colour-image-processor

## 2018 ENGGEN 131 MATLAB Project

This project repaints an image using the the specified amount of colours by processing an image which can be specified by the user. The image processor utilizes the K-means clustering aglorithm which groups up pixels based on their colours. The processor then averages the RGB values of the groups and assignments each pixel within the group the average RGB value. The processed image is then outputted.
