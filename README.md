# K-Colour-image-processor

## 2018 ENGGEN 131 MATLAB Project

This project repaints an image using the the specified amount of colours by processing an image which can be specified by the user. The image processor utilizes the K-means clustering aglorithm which groups up pixels based on their colours. The processor then averages the RGB values of the groups and assignments each pixel within the group the average RGB value. The processed image is then outputted. 

## Running the program

1. Download the zip file of the project
2. Unzip the file into a working directory
3. (OPTIONAL) Add an image that you want to be processed
4. Open and run [ConvertImage.m](https://github.com/Chuppay/K-Colour-image-processor/blob/master/ConvertImage.m)
5. Enter the parameters as instructed

This task is very intensive so the user may need to wait. However, the wait should not be too long as this program is optimised
